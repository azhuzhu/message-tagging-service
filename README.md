# message-tagging-service
Tag koji builds with the correct tags, triggered by the message bus

This is still a prototype.  It does not do any actual tagging.  But it tells you what it would tag the module build as.

This works with both python2 and python3.  You need the fedmsg libraries for whichever python you are using.

Usage: python message-tagging-service.py
